JSX: A syntax extension of JavaScript created for the React Javascript framework

Components:

- Objects
- Methods
- Functions
- Template Literals
- Arrays

JavaScript: The core language, AKA Vanilla JS

ECMAScript: The browser specification of the JS language

ES6, ES2015, ES2017, ES2020 tc....
Refers to the use of features defined in ECMAScript, but not necessarily supported by modern browsers
Also means using Babel.js to make it work in current browser implementations

TypeScript: Variation, dialect, or flavor of JS introducing features like strong typing

React, Vue, Angular: JS frameworks allowing us to write JS-based frontend apps
Introduce new coding conventions like JSX, and reliance on tools like Babel, WebPack, and Node,js

npm, WebPack, Gulp: Build tools and infrastructure to automate the process of optimizing human-readable JavaScript for the best browser performance

Node.js: JavaScript server runtime used to run Javascript everywhere; used to run npm, WebPack, Babel, and more on your computer

Tools for working with Javascript:

- Modern browser
- Code Editor
- Live Server environment (Installed as extension in VSCode)
- Browser Console

Formatting and Linting:

- Prettier helps automatically clean up your formatting
- ESLint helps automatically detect coding errors and can do basic cleanup automatically
- Both require Node.js

When there is no package.json file in folder, create project from scratch by entering this in terminal:
npm init

then do
npm install

or
npm install express --save
(--save opyion wil update package.json with the package and its version)

//Modern Javascript loading
Asynce and Defer
Default Behaviour:
Browser stops rendering when Javascript is encountered. JavaScript is executed before rendering continues. Often referred to as content blocking.

Async:
Browser downloads Javascript in parallel while html renders. When Javascript is fully loaded, rendering stops while JavaScript is executed.

- Javascript renders first before HTML

Defer:
Browser downloads Javascript in parallel while HTML renders, then defers execution of Javascript until HTML rendering is complete.

- HTML complete renders first before Javascript

async/defer should be standard:
Only use render blocking when you have specific reason. Loading Javascript in the footer is now an anti-pattern.

Objects are typically constants:
We can change the properties of the object inside the container. We can't remove or replace the object from the container.

document.querySelector
document.querySelectorAll
document.getElementsByClassName
document.getElementsById
